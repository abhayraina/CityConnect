# CityConnect+

This was our solution to WolfHacks Hackathon 2018, which was my first hackathon to attend.

The solution aimed at fixing the disorganization of services in Brampton city, as currently there are multiple different websites, a resident of Brampton has to go to in order to use a public service. Our solution aimed at simplifying that by making a single portal, where people can find all services.

Our group didn't win :(, however we were able to learn how to implement API in our website such as the GeoHub API, which served the purpose of loaction services.
